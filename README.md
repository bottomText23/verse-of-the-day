# Daily Bible verse

<img src="assets/banner.jpg" width="500px">

Puts a daily Bible verse on an image of Holo from _Spice and wolf_.

The verses are sourced from [verseoftheday.com](https://www.verseoftheday.com/), so you will need an internet connection for the script to work.

### How to use

Just run the `main.py` script. The resulting image will be placed in the same folder as the script.

Feel free to add your own images to the `assets/pictures/` subfolder. Keep in mind that the verses are placed at the **bottom** of the image.
